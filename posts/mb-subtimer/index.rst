It is the application that allows you to quickly find out how long does it take to ride
from one Warsaw subway station to another. Program calculates the total time by summing
intervals between stations. MIDlet database currently supports routes between stations *Kabaty*
and *Plac Wilsona*, and any sub-route.

.. TEASER_END

I planned to include the full data for the first subway line, although you should not expect it
to happen anymore.

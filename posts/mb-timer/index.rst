Great tool for all those, who want to measure time. MIDlet has two modes. First is the lap mode,
in which it is possible to measure up to 50 periods of time. Second is called rests mode,
useful especially for long distance runners.

.. TEASER_END

Settings allow you to set precision of the timer, and by that the usage of power
- important for mobile devices.

Another feature is the ability to save results - this feature allows to save only partial results,
for example selected laps (in lap mode). Then you can load this data and continue measurements,
ex. start next lap, or continue your long distance training.

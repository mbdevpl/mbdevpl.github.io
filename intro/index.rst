Check out `my CV </cv>`_ if you'd like to learn more.

This site is mainly a collection of posts about things that I've worked or am working on right now
- a kind of portfolio of my projects. I attempt to organize all content in a meaningful way,
usually by used programming language or technology involved. The site is powered by Nikola.
In the recent past it was Drupal and very long time ago it was Joomla.

Check out the `Projects page </projects>`_ to see all of my projects.

I also occasionally post some other stuff here.
